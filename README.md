# brainmark

little custom bookmarker thing that dumps to file. nothing fancy, nothing that anyone besides me is probably interested in.

run for dev: `web-ext run` and `web-ext run -t chromium`

install on firefox:
`web-ext build --overwrite-dest`
in nightly:
  - open about:config and set xpinstall.signatures.required to false
  - click and drag zipped file to extensions page
